Just notes and reminders for the OS.


(1) Escape Character:
    *ctrl + c(is a break. Thank you python)
    *Left Arrow, Left Keypad, when the print function is giving a time delay you can press the left keypad
    to rush the output.
    
(2)Program Tips and Tricks
    "Notepad":
        *Preferred if you type uppercase but all lowercase isnt necessary.(I.E the shell isnt case sensitive. Other program might be)
    "Printr":
        as mention you can use the left keypad to rush the output.

(3)Server:
   *The server works but its for intra... INTRANET. Not the internet. Have no way to hooking up the IBM
   or the US Military so right now its ment for local connection with no modem all you need is a wireless adapter
   *That port number dont worry. Ima change it soon. i need to brush on raw socket.
